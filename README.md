# Chai_Aur_Backend

This project is a comprehensive backend system built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, **JWT**, **bcrypt**, and many more technologies. It is a complete backend implementation that includes all the features expected from a fully functional production-grade backend.

I am building a complete video hosting platform similar to YouTube, featuring:

- Login and Signup
- Video Upload
- Like & Dislike System
- Comment and Reply
- Subscribe and Unsubscribe
- And many additional core features

The project follows standard and secure backend practices, including:

- JWT Authentication
- Access & Refresh Tokens
- Password Hashing with bcrypt
- Scalable Database Modeling
- Clean Architectural Structuring

I have spent a lot of time developing this project, and I am confident that you will learn a lot by exploring and building with it.
